Thank you!!!

Please read the debriefing below to find out more about what we are studying.

DEBRIEFING

Current models of episodic memory posit that memory formation entails binding the information we experience to the context in which we experience it.  To retrieve details of a specific episode we must then mentally time travel back to the context in which we experienced it to provide the optimal cue for our memory system.  One major question in the field is what are the salient aspects of our environment that make up the context of an experience.  The goal of this research is to explore what constitutes context by manipulating various aspects of the information studied and retrieved and observing the changes in memory behavior.

In this study, you were asked to study stimuli, such as words and/or pictures, and then recall or recognize the items that you studied.  In some cases the items you studied may have been related to one another and in some cases not.  We are particularly interested in the effect inter-item relatedness has on context and, consequently, the effect on both encoding and retrieval efficacy.  In other words, does context change based on the items you experience and, if so, how does this affect our memory.

In order to maintain the integrity of this study, please do not discuss your experiences in the experiment with other students who could potentially be participants. If others know all details of the study before participating, it could affect the results in unexpected ways.

If you have any questions about this study, please do not hesitate to ask your experimenter now.  If you have any questions or comments later, you can contact the Prinicipal Investigator, Dr. Sederberg, or the Office of Responsible Research Practices at the numbers listed on your debriefing form.

Please let the experimenter know that you have completed the experiment.
