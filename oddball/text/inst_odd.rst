------------

In this experiment we will present blocks of visual and auditory stimuli one stimulus at a time. Your task is to press the key corresponding to the matching stimulus as quickly and accurately as possible when each stimulus is presented. The mappings between stimuli and specific keyboard responses will change for each block.

The visual stimuli will be either an **X** or an **O**, while the auditory stimuli will either be a high-frequency **Beep** or a low-frequency **Boop**.

We will now review each stimulus prior to beginning the blocks.
