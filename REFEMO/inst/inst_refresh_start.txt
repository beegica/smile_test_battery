We are now about to start the actual experiment. 

The experiment will consist of a series of blocks of trials, each containing about 28 refresh trials. Again, in each trial you will see a pair of words. After each pair is presented, you will need to say the word out loud on the side the arrow points to. 

After each block you will be given a short break; when you are ready to start the next block, hit any key.
