In this task, a white square appears briefly on the screen, with a black square
within it. Participant must respond only to targets--the black square on top.
For the first half of the test, targets are rare; for the second half, they are
frequent.

This sample experiment shows how to effectively use **Subroutines**, **Loops**,
and how to display text onto the screen with **Labels**.
