Test Battery
============
Welcome to the SMILE Test Battery! Below are links to brief descriptions of
small SMILE experiments. These experiments cover a wide variety of experimental
designs and paradigms. This Test Battery features most, if not all, of the
simpler things that you can do with SMILE as well as a few of the more advanced
techniques.

Fully Explained Examples
========================

Below are a list of fully explained example Experiments. These are a few very
important experiments from the history of Psychology. The links below will lead
to documents detailing the entirety of these experiments, moving from setting up
the configuration variables and list generations, to what SMILE states are
needed to run these experiments. These docs also come with a mini-analysis
section to explain how to get at the data.
